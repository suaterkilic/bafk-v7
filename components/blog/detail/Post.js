                              tradition (Shou Sugi Ban)
                              <br />
                              IRORI provides an unreleased book of natural
                              materials by starting from the Black Irori Stone
                              up to the woods, which are suggested apart from
                              the Smoked elm also in the Shou Sugi Ban
                              processing technique, the centuries-old Japanese
                              method of wood treatment obtained by superficial
                              carbonization. The result is given by an elegant
                              blackbrown colored wood, of which the intensity
                              depends on the type of wood and on how long and
                              deep the combustion process has lasted.

                              Choosing your furniture first helps you hone in on
                              a palette more naturally. If you find yourself
                              gravitating to really strong, bright colors for
                              your chairs and sofas, a neutral wall color is
                              easy to style against. But what if you fall in
                              love with a sofa — like, head over heels, can’t
                              eat, can’t sleep in love with this sofa — and it
                              only comes in neutral colors? The sofa and you
                              belong together, so it’s coming home. But you
                              might want to change up your wall color to
                              accommodate this unexpected change in plan.
                              Remember: paint options are infinite, but
                              furniture comes in a specific selection of shapes
                              and colors.
